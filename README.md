This is a Data Exploration project, carried out on a covid dataset using the SQL analytical tool.
 I was able to describe the dataset characterizations, such as the size, relevance and accuracy of the data values.
 I created a CTE to temporarialy store data while writing my queries. 
 In order to Visualize my dataset, I created a view where i stored the data for visualization purposes.
